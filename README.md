# Talks, articles & online courses
I love sharing knowledge in written or spoken form. I speak at remote or in-person events around Europe about various topics related to machine learning, artificial intelligence, ethical AI and explainable AI.
[Email me](beckerlisa93@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/becker-lisa) if you're interested in me speaking at your event or writing an article! See below for a list of past and planned talks, articles and online courses I've published.
